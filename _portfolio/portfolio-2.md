Fire Fighting Robot is a machine that, after detecting a flame in its surroundings, goes to
where the flame signal is coming from, and then puts off the fire by spraying water. This was
done through Arduino. This bot is portable and can move to any direction without any human
intervention.

3 Types of sensors were place around the structure of the bot and the structure
that the whole bot is placed on is very strong. This machine can be placed inside any type of
room that has flat floor surface. It requires very less power and cheap to building. Placing this
bot inside any house or office, is a great safety measure to follow and if equipped with full
capability it can be concluded as a life saving device.

Here's a demo run of our project (without the water):
