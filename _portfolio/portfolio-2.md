Lead a three person research team to introduce the development of a fire fighting robot that can extinguish fire without the need for fire fighters to be exposed to unnecessary danger. It is designed to be compact in size than other conventional fire-fighting robot in order to ease small location entry for deeper reach of extinguishing fire in narrow space. It is also equipped with ultrasonic sensor to avoid it from hitting any obstacle and surrounding objects, while flame sensor is attached for fire detection. This resulted in demonstrating capabilities of identifying fire locations automatically and ability to extinguish fire remotely at particular distance.
