Hello, I’m Zinia Sultana Joti, a first-year PhD student from [Dibakar Datta Laboratory](https://dibakardatta.net) in the department of Mechanical Engineering at the New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT). I completed my bachelor’s degree in Mechanical Engineering at Shahjalal University of Science and Technology (SUST). I later pursued a master’s degree in Applied Statistics and Data Science at Jahangirnagar University (JU) under the weekend program(project incomplete).  


My current research focuses on applying Generative AI to the study of biological materials, where computational intelligence meets the complexities of material behavior. Previously, I worked with Molecular Dynamics simulations to explore high-entropy alloys, dislocations, and deformation mechanisms in single-crystal nanostructures. These experiences have fostered my interest in integrating traditional modeling methods with data-driven approaches to gain a deeper understanding of materials at multiple scales.  

You can explore the different sections of this site to learn more about my research, projects, and academic journey.

## Previous Wroks
### Open Source Contributions
------
My experience involves working on Materials characterization. My report on a comparison study using molecular dynamics approach is open-sourced on [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/383490197_A_Comparison_Study_of_Metals_Mechanical_Properties_Under_Tensile_Loading_Using_Molecular_Dynamics_Simulations).

I am also applying my learnings on python using jupyter notebooks. You can find my projects on python, machine learning etc. here: [Github](https://github.com/ZiniaJoti) and [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/ziniajoti).
