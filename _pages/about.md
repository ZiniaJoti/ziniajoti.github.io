Hello, This is Zinia Sultana Joti. I am a PhD student at New Jersey Institute of Technology. I have completed my bachelor's degree from Shahjalal University of Science and Technology, Sylhet, Bangladesh. I have completed the theoretical coursework (project incomplete) for a Master's degree under the weekend program in Applied Statistics and Data Science at Jahangirnagar University.  You can navigate to different pages here to see my works. 

My current research focus is on using Generative AI on biological materials. Previously, I worked with Molecular Dynamics simulations to learn more about High-Entropy Alloys, Dislocations, and deformation mechanisms in single-crystal nanostructures.

# Open Source Contributions
------
My experience involves working on Materials characterization. My report on a comparison study using molecular dynamics approach is open-sourced on [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/383490197_A_Comparison_Study_of_Metals_Mechanical_Properties_Under_Tensile_Loading_Using_Molecular_Dynamics_Simulations).

I am also applying my learnings on python using jupyter notebooks. You can find my projects on python, machine learning etc. here: [Github](https://github.com/ZiniaJoti) and [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/ziniajoti).
