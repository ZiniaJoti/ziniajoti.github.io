* Conducted a literature review on composite-based laminated structure for aircraft construction by thoroughly assessing relevant research papers which focuses on the challenges faced by aircraft such as lightning strikes, bird impacts and turbulence.
* Modeled lightning strike protection (LSP) plate in Abaqus using Carbon Fiber Reinforced Composite (CFRP) plates with Carbon Nanotube (CNT) layers with a ply stack-up of [+45/0/-45/90]3s for quasi-isotropic structure.
* Analyzed the progressive failure utilizing the PUCK failure criteria to assess suitability for aerospace application.
